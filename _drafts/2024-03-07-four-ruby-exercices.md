## Ruby exercices, what for ?

For newcomers it's a very good occasion to train your skills and/or prepare for an interview.

From my experience, most business apps do not require heavy algorithm knowledge, however, when they occur, it's best not to spend too much time on it.

Sometimes it's a breeze of fresh air for more experienced developer to go back the basics of the Ruby API, instead of solving large chunks integration problem.

So here are 4 not-too-easy (but that shouldn't take much of your time) problems to solve, I hope you'll enjoy them :) 

## Find uniq anagrams of a given String

Find the number of anagrams that are a palindrom for a given String. It should return 0 for empty String or unexpected argument, 1 for "a", 2 for "abba", and 6 for "okayako"

## Swap elements by pair inside an Array

Swap elements in a array, but only by pair. For example, ['a', 'b'] becomes ['b', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] becomes ['b', 'a', 'd', 'c'], and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] becomes [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5].

## Fire langage

After each vowel inside a String, add a "f", followed by the vowel. For example, "a" becomes "afa", "hello" becomes "hefellofo", and "hello world" becomes "hefellofo woforld".

## Cup repartition

You should give each kid the same number of cups. For example, [{name: "bob", cups:1},{name: "jen", cups:7}] should become [{name: "bob", cups:4},{name: "jen", cups:4}]

## Bonus

As you noticed, there is nothing special in these exercices. You can also try to solve them in JS or Python, since they don't imply any kind of weird or langage-specific type.

## Summary

That's it for today.
