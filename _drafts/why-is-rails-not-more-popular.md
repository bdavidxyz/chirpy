## Intro

I had once a conversation with an American at breakfast.

He was eating a fresh French baguette, and seemed to be worried... his question finally was :

> Why is that so good?
{: .prompt-info } 

Why Americans do not make such baguette was for him a mystery. Some cultural shift I guess?

Now let's go back to the Rails community. If Rails is so 

- incredible (which is true) 
- with such a strong and vibrant community (also true), 
- and an incredibly productive stack (again true!),

Finally,

> If Rails is so good, why is Rails not **more** popular nowadays?
{: .prompt-danger }


## UI driven development


## Ruby

## Static types
