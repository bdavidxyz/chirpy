## Prerequisites

Here are the tools we will use in this tutorial :

```
$> ruby -v  
ruby 3.1.0p0 // you need at least version 3 here  
$> bundle -v  
Bundler version 2.2.11  
$> npm -v  
8.3.0 // you need at least version 7.1 here  
$> yarn -v  
1.22.10
$> psql --version  
psql (PostgreSQL) 13.1 // let's use a production-ready database locally  
$> redis-cli ping // redis is a dependency of Sidekiq
PONG
$> foreman -v
0.87.2
```

## Create  a minimalistic, empty Rails app

By default, a Rails application already embeds Action Mailer, but for this tutorial, this is something we precisely want to build without help. Rails offers a `--minimal` option that allows the developer to get the bare minimum files for a Rails app, see this article : [https://www.bootrails.com/blog/rails-new-options/](https://www.bootrails.com/blog/rails-new-options/)

Also by default, Rails offers no route, no view, no controller, so here are the commands to create a `--minimal` Rails app with at least one welcome page that works :

```bash  
mkdir railsmails && cd railsmails  
echo "source 'https://rubygems.org'" > Gemfile  
echo "gem 'rails', '~> 7.0.0'" >> Gemfile  
bundle install  
bundle exec rails new . --force -d=postgresql --minimal

# Create a default controller
echo "class WelcomeController < ApplicationController" > app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
echo "end" >> app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb

# Create a default route
echo "Rails.application.routes.draw do" > config/routes.rb
echo '  get "welcome/index"' >> config/routes.rb
echo '  root to: "welcome#index"' >> config/routes.rb
echo 'end' >> config/routes.rb

# Create a default view
mkdir app/views/welcome
echo '<h1>This is h1 title</h1>' > app/views/welcome/index.html.erb


# Create database and schema.rb
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate

```

## First step : require ActionMailer in the application

Open application.rb and uncomment line with `action_mailer` as follow :

```ruby
# inside config/application.rb
require_relative "boot"

require "rails"
# Pick the frameworks you want:
require "active_model/railtie"
# require "active_job/railtie"
require "active_record/railtie"
# require "active_storage/engine"
require "action_controller/railtie"
require "action_mailer/railtie" # ‚áê Uncomment

# ... everything else remains the same
```

## Create ApplicationMailer, our base Class 

```ruby
# inside app/mailers/application_mailer.rb
class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: "from@example.com"
  layout "mailer"
end
```

Ok ! Very interesting here. 

 - We guess that the sender is "from@example" by default, which is 1) not the address we want and 2) we probably don't want it to be public anyway. So a good place would be to put it inside a `.env` file.
 - A layout is needed, just like plain Rails Views.
 - Last but not least, by integrating ourself this base class, we are now aware of pieces of configuration, that our mind would have skipped if the app was built "as usual" (i.e. without the `--minimal` flag)

## Create classic layout

Create `app/views/layouts/mailer.html.erb`

```html
<!-- inside app/views/layouts/mailer.html.erb -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <style>
      /* Email styles need to be inline */
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Development mode

In development, you don't want any real e-mail to go out of the application, this might be too dangerous.
  
To avoid this, add the `letter_opener` gem to your Gemfile. Any email sent will then just be a file written on your local disk, that will be displayed instantly in the browser, once the email is sent.

```ruby
# inside Gemfile
gem 'letter_opener', group: :development
```

Then run 

```ruby
bundle install
```

Then configure `config/environments/development.rb` by adding the following few lines :

```ruby
# inside config/environments/development.rb
# ...
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
  config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true 
# ...
```

Now make possible for the app to send an email :

```ruby
# inside app/mailers/hello_mailer.rb
class HelloMailer < ApplicationMailer

  default from: 'me@example.com'

  def welcome_email
    @user = params[:user]
    mail(to: @user[:email], subject: 'Welcome to My Awesome Site')
  end

end
```

**Side notes** : 

 - `mail` will actually deliver the email, it comes from the inherited ApplicationMailer.
 - The e-mail will be sent from 'me@example.com' as stated in the 2nd line

Now create a file `welcome_email.html.erb` inside `app/views/hello_mailer` :

```html
<!-- inside app/views/hello_mailer/welcome_email.html.erb -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to example.com, <%= @user[:name] %></h1>
    <p>Thanks for joining and have a great day!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now you can send the email from anywhere in your application. Let's see how.

```ruby
# inside config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "welcome/index"

  # route where you will send an email
  post "welcome/please_send_email"

  # where visitor are redirected once email has been sent
  get "welcome/email_sent"

  root to: "welcome#index"
end
```

```ruby
# inside app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
class WelcomeController < ApplicationController

  def index
  end

  def please_send_email
    HelloMailer.with(user: {name: 'jane', email: 'jane@example.com'}).welcome_email.deliver_later
  end
  
  def email_sent
  end
  
end
```

**Side notes** : 

 - Here we use OpenStruct to mimic a Ruby Object
 - `deliver_later` allows us to send email in the background, in development or test mode, email will be send immediately, but we need a 3rd party tool like Sidekiq to take care of background jobs in production, see this article : [https://www.bootrails.com/blog/rails-sidekiq-tutorial/](https://www.bootrails.com/blog/rails-sidekiq-tutorial/)

Now build the views

```erb
<%# inside app/views/welcome/index.html.erb %>
<h1>This is h1 title</h1>

<%= form_with url: welcome_please_send_email_path do |f| %>
 <%= f.submit 'Send e-mail' %>
<% end %>
```

```erb
<%# inside app/views/welcome/email_sent.html.erb %>
<h1>We tried to send an email</h1>
<p>Please check the logs</p>
```

Launch your local web server by running :
```
$> bin/rails s
```

The following screen should be displayed :

<figure>  
<img style="display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:80%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bdavidxyz-com/image/upload/v1644749283/rails/mailer1.png" loading="lazy" alt="localhost">  
<figcaption style="display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:80%">localhost</figcaption>  
</figure>  


Now click the button, an email should be shown in a new tab :

<figure>  
<img style="display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:80%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bdavidxyz-com/image/upload/v1644749735/rails/mailer3.png" loading="lazy" alt="new tab">  
<figcaption style="display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:80%">new tab</figcaption>  
</figure>  


Check the logs in the console :

```

```

Great ! We're now able to send e-mail in development mode.

## Test mode

Now the tricky part. In test mode, 

 - you don't want real e-mails to be  sent, 
 - you also don't want e-mails to be displayed in the browser like in dev mode,
 - you don't want e-mails to stay forever in the job queue

To avoid all this, open `config/environments/test.rb` :
Add these 3 lines at the bottom of the file
```
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 5100 }
  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test
  config.active_job.queue_adapter = :test
```

`default_url_options` actual values don't really matter in test mode, but be aware that in production, you need to add the actual domain here in the `host` key.

Now google around to see where to put `perform_enqueued_jobs` in your test - you could wrap your test around this block, or simply call `ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter.perform_enqueued_jobs = true` before your test suite.

Then, in your test, all you have to do to read the body of the last received email is something like this :

```ruby
ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.try(:last).try(:body).try(:decoded)
```

## Production

In production, in order to send real e-mail to real people, you need a 3rd party tool like Mandrill, MailChimp or PostMark. 

The steps are as follow :

 - So subscribe to any of these 3rd party provider, they generally have a large generous free tier, and anyway sending e-mail will not work at scale with free e-mail provider like Gmail (this is not recommended to try)
 
 - Install the corresponding Ruby gem
 
 - Follow docs to get the API key, and configure your Rails app as stated in the docs

Here are the step for PostMark : [https://postmarkapp.com/send-email/rails](https://postmarkapp.com/send-email/rails)

**Warning** ! The PostMark tutorial wants you to modify `config/application.rb`, which is not a good idea : the config will apply to dev and test mode. Instead, put the configuration inside `config/environments/production.rb`


## That's it

Sending email with Rails is not complicated, but you have to take care of each 3 environments separately: development, test, and production. 3 environments, 3 different ways to handle emails. With this in mind, and a slow but well-understood first installation, you should not encounter any problem when dealing with emails.

Enjoy !
